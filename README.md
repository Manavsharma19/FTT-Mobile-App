The mobile app component of our Financial Tech Trading project was developed using Java for backend logic and XML for the frontend layout in Android Studio. The app integrates Firebase for real-time data management, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their trading activities efficiently. 

Key features include Google sign-in for quick access, a recycler view for listing stocks and cryptocurrencies, and additional functionalities like in-app support calls and a rate and review system for user feedback. 

The app is designed to offer a seamless user experience with easy navigation and real-time updates, enhancing accessibility and engagement for financial trading on the go.
